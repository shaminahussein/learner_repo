                    HTMLs stands for HyperText Markup 
                    Language. It is used to design 
                    web pages using a markup language.
                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext
                    and Markup language. Hypertext 
                    defines the link between the web 
                    pages. A markup language is used 
                    to define the text document within 
                    tag which defines the structure of 
                    web pages. HTML is a markup language
                    that is used by the browser to 
                    manipulate text, images, and other
                    content to display it in the required 
                    format.

                    C is a procedural programming language.
                    It was initially developed by Dennis 
                    Ritchie as a system programming 
                    language to write operating system. 
                    The main features of C language include
                    low-level access to memory, simple set 
                    of keywords, and clean style, these 
                    features make C language suitable for
                    system programming like operating system 
                    or compiler development.

                Java has been one of the most 
                popular programming language 
                for many years. Java is Object 
                Oriented. However it is not 
                considered as pure object oriented
                as it provides support for primitive
                data types (like int, char, etc) The
                Java codes are first compiled into byte
                code (machine independent code). Then
                the byte code is run on Java Virtual
                Machine (JVM) regardless of the
                underlying architecture.
